            <h1>Who Am I ?</h1>
            <p>It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to my website! In case this is your first time here,
            let me introduce myself.<br /><br />
                My name is Mumtahin Zihan, and I am an aspiring software developer.<br /><br />
                If you're here on official business, you should find any information about my work (.......)<br /><br />
                If you just want to know more about me and how I stumbled across my passion for software development,
            here you go:<br /><br />
                Since my childhood I was very keen on new technologies and gadgets. I wanted to be a Computer Engineer. But unfortunately, I had to step into a career as military officer.
                 I've lived and travelled many countries as a govermental Close Protection Officer (those guys in black suits and black sunglasses)
              but it didn't really fulfill me.<br />
                Don't get me wrong, it was nice travelling and meeting new people from different countries but I just felt
              like I needed to do something else, something creative. <br />
                So I landed as a Sales and Marketing representative in a corporate environment, but this wasn't quite what I was looking for either.<br /><br />
                My mind kept saying "if i would be able to fulfill my aspired proffession". One day, out of curiosity, I decided to go to a Kodiri meet-up and was so impressed with the work they do,
                 which was coding. Websites, we think are so simple to look at, they require a lot of effort (and brainwork!)
              to make it look the way we want them to be - my fascination was grown insanely then.<br /><br />
                I decided to join Kodiri bootcamp and learn the world of coding and voil√† - here we are! I've enjoyed it since :)<br />
                You may also ask yourself , what I do in my free time - no I don't ONLY code and sit with my laptop! I enjoy playing
                 cricket, running, watching movies and series (big fan of FRIENDS).. But I also love to cook and try new recipes,
              go on long walks and enjoy the nature and of course travel and learn more about other cultures.<br /><br />
                So if there's anything else you want to learn about me, send me an email and let's connect!<br /><br />
                Hope to hear from you soon,<br /><br />
