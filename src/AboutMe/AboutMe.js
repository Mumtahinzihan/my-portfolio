      <p>It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to my website! In case this is your first time here,
            let me introduce myself.<br /><br />
        My name is Mumtahin Zihan, and I am an aspiring software developer.<br /><br />
        If you're here on official business, you should find any information about my work <Link className='here' to='my-projects'><b>here.</b>
        </Link><br /><br />
        If you just want to know more about me and how I stumbled across my passion for software development,
            here you go:<br /><br />
        Since my childhood I have been very keen on understanding the nature and functionalities of computers.
        I wanted to be a Computer Engineer, but unfortunately,
         I had to step into a career as military officer.
        I've lived and travelled many countries as a govermental Close Protection Officer (those guys in black suits and black sunglasses)
            but it didn't really fulfill me.<br />
        Don't get me wrong, it was nice travelling and meeting new people from different countries but I just felt
            like I needed to do something else, something more creative. <br />
        So I landed as a Sales and Marketing representative in a corporate environment, but this wasn't quite what I was looking for either.<br /><br />
        One day, out of curiosity, I decided to go to a Kodiri meet-up and was so impressed with the work they do,
        which was coding. Websites, we think are so simple to look at but they require a lot of effort (and brainwork!)
            to make it look the way we want them to be - my fascination was grown then.<br /><br />
        I decided to join Kodiri bootcamp and learn the world of coding and voil√† - here we are! I've enjoyed it since :)<br />
        You may also ask yourself , what I do in my free time - no I don't ONLY code and sit with my laptop! I enjoy playing
        cricket, running, watching movies and series (big fan of FRIENDS).. But I also love to cook and try new recipes,
            go on long walks and enjoy the nature and of course travel and learn more about other cultures.<br /><br />
        So if there's anything else you want to learn about me, send me an email and let's connect!<br /><br />
        Hope to hear from you soon,<br /><br />
        Mumtahin
